# Hangman-game-CLI

PYTHON

A CLI game replicating Hangman

Using Python, I have created a series of util functions that make up the individual parts of the game then used these functions to replicate the game.

Instructions for running game:
  1. run python hangman.py
  2. follow instructions in CLI
  3. ENJOY !!
